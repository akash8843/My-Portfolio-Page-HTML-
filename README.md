# 🌐 HTML Portfolio Website

This is a **basic personal portfolio website** created using **only HTML**.  
I built this project while learning the fundamentals of web development.

## 📌 About the Project
This project was created during my **learning phase** to understand:
- HTML structure and semantic tags  
- Creating sections like Education, Skills, and Contact  
- Hosting a static website using GitHub Pages  

The main focus of this project is **learning**, not design.
